{"name":"Space Chase","tagline":"Open Source. Cross Platform. Mobile Multiplayer Game","body":"## Space Chase\r\n\r\nSpace Chase is an open source, cross platform, mobile multiplayer sample game created by us at Nextpeer. We created this game to demonstrate what the Nextpeer Multiplayer SDK is capable of, and how to do it. We try to provide as many tools we can for our developers so they can create the best games they can. Developers are now able see all the main functionalities of our SDK and review the code to really see how it is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Features:\r\n+ **Real Time Multiplayer** - Users can experience real time tournaments against each.\r\n+ **Cross Platform** - Players can interact across Android and iOS devices.\r\n+ **Seeing Opponents** - Allowing users to see one another on screen provides for a much more exciting experience.\r\n+ **Power Ups** - Players can attack and defend against one another, adding a whole new environment to the game.\r\n+ **Multiple Levels** (And Random Seed) - Having a few different levels keeps players interested and the use of the random seed ensures all players are on the same level, seeing the same things.\r\n+ **Avatar Selection** - Giving users different characters to select from lets them see know who they are and adds variation in the game. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/space-chase-multiplayer-race/id817547888?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/nextpeer_dashboard_docs/markdown/misc/appstore.png\"></a> <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextpeer.sample.CnD&hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/nextpeer_dashboard_docs/markdown/misc/googleplay.png\"></a>\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
